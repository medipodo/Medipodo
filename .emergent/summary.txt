<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to add two new images to the gallery page. This evolved into a series of tasks including:
1.  Cloning a GitHub repository to work on the project.
2.  Resolving a major deployment failure by restoring the entire project from a user-provided backup zip file.
3.  Creating and updating multiple blog posts with specific content, SEO rules (internal links, sitemap updates, FAQ schemas, OG images), and modern design layouts.
4.  Fixing layout and styling issues across various blog pages, including color schemes and responsive padding.
5.  Optimizing site performance by removing unnecessary image preloads and ensuring blog images are lazy-loaded.
6.  Fixing a frontend build error that caused the app preview to fail.
7.  Increasing the number of FAQs displayed on the homepage.
8.  Updating images on the diabetes blog page from  to  format with new SEO-friendly filenames.
9.  The final request, which is currently in progress, is to implement 301 redirects for the old image URLs to preserve SEO ranking.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**
- Add 2 new images to the gallery.
- Update the  post with new content, SEO improvements, and a modern design.
- Update the  post with internal links.
- Optimize image loading across all blog pages (remove preloads, use lazy loading).
- Fix various styling and layout bugs on blog pages.
- Create a new blog post .
- Create a new blog post .
- Standardize author name across all blogs.
- Update publication dates for several blogs.
- Update images on  to  and set up 301 redirects.

**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **Turkish**. The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a static frontend application built with React and Tailwind CSS. It's a website for Medipodo, a podology center. There is no backend or database; all content for the gallery and blog posts is managed through hardcoded data in JavaScript files (, ). SEO is handled manually by editing  and using  for meta tags. Deployment is handled by Netlify, which uses a  file for URL redirection. Several blog posts have been added and updated with custom layouts and specific SEO optimizations.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Implementing 301 redirects for the 11 images that were updated on the  page. The user requested that old  URLs be permanently redirected to their new  counterparts to preserve SEO value.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Manual testing by curl. After the redirects are added to  and the changes are deployed, the agent must verify that the redirects are working correctly. This can be done using  to check for a  status code and the correct  header pointing to the new  URL.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0)**: Complete the implementation of 301 redirects for updated diabetes blog images.

    **Issues Detail**:
    -   **Issue 1**:
        -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified the  file as the place to add the rules. The agent also has the list of old and new filenames from previous steps. However, the rules have not yet been written to the file.
        -   **Next debug checklist**:
            1.  Re-confirm the list of 11 old  filenames and their corresponding new  filenames for the diabetes blog.
            2.  Construct the 301 redirect rules in the format Netlify requires. Example: 
            3.  Append these 11 rules to the  file.
        -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To prevent 404 errors for any indexed or cached old image URLs and to transfer the SEO ranking from the old images to the new ones.
        -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
        -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
        -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend (deployment and URL checks).
        -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Add 301 Redirects for Diabetes Blog Images
    -   **Where to resume**: Edit the file .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: All old  image URLs from the diabetes blog page will correctly redirect to their new  counterparts, ensuring no broken links and preserving SEO.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on something**: None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
-   **Routing**: 
-   **Content Management**: Content is hardcoded in JavaScript objects and arrays within  files. This is a non-standard, CMS-less approach.
-   **SEO**: Manual management of  and injection of meta tags and JSON-LD schemas via .
-   **Deployment**: The site is hosted on Netlify, which is configured via files in the  directory like .

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (No database)
-   **Blog Post Object** in : 
-   **Gallery Image Object** in : 

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Needs to be modified to complete the current task.
-   : Was recently updated with new image paths.
-   : The central file for all blog metadata and content.
-   : Contains all application routes.
-   : Manually managed sitemap.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **Content Management**: The current system of storing all blog content in a massive  file and creating separate JSX components for custom layouts is not scalable. It leads to code duplication and makes content updates cumbersome. A migration to a headless CMS or a more structured data format (e.g., separate JSON/MD files per post) would be a significant improvement.
-   **Data Duplication**: Metadata like author and date are sometimes present in both  and the individual JSX page components, creating two sources of truth. The JSX components should always pull this data from .

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   This is a static React site with no backend. All data is hardcoded in JS files.
-   The user is highly focused on SEO. Pay close attention to instructions regarding sitemaps, redirects, meta tags, and internal linking.
-   Redirects are managed via the  file for Netlify.
-   The current pattern for updating blogs with a modern design is to create a new, dedicated JSX component in .

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   None.
