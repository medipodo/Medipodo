**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is **Turkish**. The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a static frontend application built with React and Tailwind CSS for a podology center (Medipodo). All content is managed through hardcoded data in JavaScript files (). A new pattern has been established where some pages (like the Bağlıca landing page) use a  property in  to exist outside the  path. The  and  components have been updated to support this custom routing logic. Deployment is managed via Netlify, which uses a  file for redirects.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The agent was addressing the user's request to ensure that the  dates in  are consistent with the actual content update dates of each blog post.
-   **Status**: BLOCKED
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: This is not a testing issue. The agent is blocked waiting for user input. The next step is to receive the user's decision on which source of truth to use for the dates (initial publication date, file modification date, or manual input) and then implement the changes in .
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0)**: Resolve the   date inconsistency.

    **Issues Detail**:
    -   **Issue 1**: The  dates in  do not consistently match the publication dates in  or the file system's last modification dates. The user wants the dates to be accurate for SEO purposes.
        -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent has successfully identified the discrepancies by comparing dates from three sources: , , and the file system modification times. It correctly identified the ambiguity of the request (update date can mean different things) and presented the user with clear options.
        -   **Next debug checklist**:
            1.  Wait for the user's response to the question: Which date source should be the source of truth for ? (Options provided were:  publication dates, file system modification dates, or manual specification).
            2.  Based on the user's choice, update the  file to reflect the correct dates for all URLs.
        -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To provide accurate  dates to search engines, which is a best practice for SEO. This helps crawlers understand how frequently content is updated and can influence crawling priority.
        -   **Status**: BLOCKED
        -   **Is recurring issue?**: N
        -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Neither. The fix only involves editing .
